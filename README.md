# HR Attrition Analysis – SQL & Power BI

## Objective of the Analysis
Employee attrition directly impacts organizational cost, productivity, and workforce stability.  

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To identify the **key causes of employee attrition**
- To analyze **which employee segments are most at risk**
- To provide **data-driven recommendations** that support HR retention strategies
